# Existing Systems & Platforms Similar to Your Features

## 1. Feature 1A & 1B – Crop Recommendation Based on Month, District & Market Trends

- **Krishi Tantradhara (Govt of Karnataka initiative)**  
  Provides district-level crop recommendations based on soil, rainfall, and historical trends. However, it does not combine **market price forecasts** with agronomy data.

- **CropIn**  
  Agritech SaaS platform offering predictive intelligence for crop planning and yield forecasting. Mostly enterprise-focused, not tailored for individual smallholder farmers in local languages.

- **AgroStar**  
  App where farmers get crop advice, but recommendations are static and **do not dynamically link planting months with forecasted market prices.**

- **RML AgTech (Reuters Market Light)**  
  Gives farmers weather and market price info, but not optimized for **district-level crop cycle planning** based on future market conditions.

⚡ **Gap:** None of the above solutions combine **district-level month-by-month crop recommendation** with **market trend forecasts** at the farmer-facing level.

## 2. Feature 2 – 15-Day Price Forecast for Stored Produce

- **NCDEX & AgMarknet**  
  Provide mandi prices, but only historical and real-time. **No forecasting** for short-term (7–15 day) trends for perishable crops.

- **Gramophone**  
  Gives mandi rates and advisory, but does not provide **predictive price outlooks**.

- **Fasal**  
  IoT and AI platform for farmers. Focuses on weather and crop disease prediction, not **price trend forecasting.**

- **RML AgTech**  
  Offers near real-time prices, not **forward-looking price predictions.**

⚡ **Gap:** No mainstream solution provides a **short-term (15-day) predictive price advisory**, which is crucial for deciding **sell vs store**.

## 3. Why Your Idea Stands Out

- **Localized (district + month specific) + Predictive**  
  Existing systems are either **reactive** (show current prices, weather) or **generic** (state-level advice). None combine **weather + market trends** in a farmer-facing, easy-to-use platform.

- **Actionable for Smallholders**  
  Instead of overwhelming farmers with data, your system directly answers:  
  - *What should I plant this month in my district?*  
  - *If I plant X crop, which month is best for harvest?*  
  - *I have produce, should I sell now or wait 15 days?*

- **Innovation Sweet Spot**  
  Judges will clearly see you’ve spotted the **critical gaps in current agritech solutions** and are filling them with an AI-first approach tailored for Indian smallholder farmers.
