# ðŸ”„ Project Reorganization Instructions

## ðŸ“‹ What You Need to Do

I've created scripts to help you reorganize your project structure. Here are your options:

### Option 1: Run the Batch Script (Windows)
1. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell
2. Navigate to the `final` folder
3. Run: `reorganize_structure.bat`

### Option 2: Run the PowerShell Script
1. Open PowerShell
2. Navigate to the `final` folder
3. Run: `.\reorganize_structure.ps1`

### Option 3: Manual Commands
If you prefer to run commands manually:

```bash
# Navigate to the final folder
cd "D:\kuch bhi two\final"

# Move model files to backend
move crop_recommendation_model.pkl backend\
move data_processor.pkl backend\
move price_forecast_model.pkl backend\
move agritech_analysis_dashboard.png backend\
move price_forecast_sample.png backend\

# Delete Streamlit frontend
rmdir /s /q frontend

# Rename react-frontend to frontend
move react-frontend frontend
```

## âœ… Expected Result

After running the script, your structure will be:

```
final/
â”œâ”€â”€ backend/                    # Complete backend with everything
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app.py                 # Flask API
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt       # Dependencies
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ README.md             # Documentation
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ crop_recommendation_model.pkl
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ data_processor.pkl
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ price_forecast_model.pkl
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ agritech_analysis_dashboard.png
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ price_forecast_sample.png
â”œâ”€â”€ frontend/                   # React frontend (renamed from react-frontend)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ src/                   # React source code
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ dist/                  # Built app
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ package.json           # Node.js dependencies
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...                    # All React files
â”œâ”€â”€ model_pipline/             # ML training
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pipeline.py
â””â”€â”€ README.md                  # Updated project docs
```

## ðŸš€ After Reorganization

### Start Backend:
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

### Start Frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Benefits of This Structure

- **Backend**: Contains everything needed for the API (models, images, code)
- **Frontend**: Clean React app with modern UI
- **Simple**: Only 2 main folders + training pipeline
- **Deployment Ready**: Easy to deploy on any platform

## ðŸ“ž Need Help?

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check that you're in the correct directory (`final` folder)
2. Make sure no files are open in your IDE
3. Try running the commands one by one manually
4. Let me know if you need assistance!
