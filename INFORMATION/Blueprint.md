# AI-Driven Platform for Forecasting Local Market Demand and Preventing Crop Gluts

## Project Overview
An AI-driven platform to forecast local crop demand and guide farmers on **what to grow, when to sell, and where to distribute**, reducing oversupply, food waste, and income instability.  
Built as a **24-hour hackathon MVP** with focus on practicality, Indian agriculture context, and demo-ready output.

## End-to-End Flow
1. **Data Ingestion**
   - Collect market price & volume data (APMCs, Agmarknet, mock CSV).
   - Include seasonal trends (historical crop cycles).
   - Optional: weather data for crop supply proxy.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Clean and structure: crop name, market, date, volume, price.
   - Aggregate weekly/monthly demand trends.

3. **AI/ML Forecasting**
   - Use lightweight time-series models (ARIMA, Prophet, or Random Forest).
   - Predict **near-future demand & price** for key crops.

4. **Recommendation Engine**
   - Output simple guidance for farmers:
     - **Grow/Donâ€™t Grow** (based on predicted demand).
     - **Best time to sell** (price peak forecast).
     - **Best markets** (regional comparison).

5. **Frontend (Farmer View)**
   - Simple dashboard:
     - Forecast graphs (demand & price trends).
     - Recommendations in plain text.
   - Multi-language (English + Hindi/Kannada placeholder).

6. **Backend & APIs**
   - ML model wrapped in Flask/FastAPI.
   - Endpoints for predictions & recommendations.

7. **Deployment**
   - Push MVP to GitHub.
   - Host on Streamlit/Render/Heroku for demo.
   - Keep lightweight & offline-first compatible.

## Datasets (Practical for Hackathon)
- **Agmarknet (Government of India)** â€“ crop prices & arrivals by market.  
  ðŸ‘‰ Use sample CSVs for faster implementation.  
- **Kaggle Datasets** â€“ "India Crop Production", "Vegetable Prices Dataset".  
- **Synthetic Data** â€“ prepare small mock datasets if APIs are slow.  

*(Judges care about prototype, not dataset size â€“ clarity > scale.)*

## Tech Stack
### Frontend
- **Streamlit (fast)** or React.js (if UI-focused).
- Bootstrap/Tailwind for visuals.

### Backend
- Flask/FastAPI (serve ML predictions).
- SQLite/CSV for lightweight data storage.

### ML
- Prophet/ARIMA for time-series demand forecasting.
- Pandas/Scikit-learn for preprocessing.

### Deployment
- GitHub repo (clean, structured).
- Streamlit Cloud/Heroku/Render for live demo.

## Project Pitch (for Judges)
### Problem
- Farmers often face **oversupply & crop gluts** â†’ low prices, food waste, income loss.
- Lack of **local demand forecasting tools** worsens the issue.

### Solution
- An **AI-driven platform** that forecasts demand, predicts prices, and guides farmers on:
  - What to grow.
  - When to sell.
  - Where to distribute.

### Impact
- Reduces **food waste**.
- Improves **farmer income stability**.
- Strengthens **local food security**.
- Scalable to pan-India with more data.

### Demo
- Show dashboard with **forecast graphs** + **recommendations**.
- Walkthrough of farmerâ€™s decision-making with platform guidance.
- Mention **future enhancements**:
  - Real-time weather/IoT integration.
  - Regional cooperative-level insights.
  - WhatsApp/SMS farmer alerts.

## Hackathon Strategy
- **MVP First (12 hours)** â†’ data â†’ ML â†’ simple dashboard â†’ deploy.
- **Polish Later (next 12 hours)** â†’ UI, presentation, future roadmap.
- Focus on **clarity + impact**, not exhaustive dataset/model.
