# AI for Forecasting Local Market Demand and Preventing Crop Gluts

## ‚úÖ What You *Can* Implement in 24 Hours (MVP)

Focus only on things that give a **visible demo** + **storytelling power**:

1. **Data + Forecasting Model (Core AI)**
   - Use **open datasets** (Agmarknet, APMC mandi prices, or Kaggle) for 1‚Äì2 crops (e.g., tomato, onion).
   - Train a simple **time-series model** (Prophet / ARIMA / XGBoost).
   - Output: Predicted price/demand trend for next 7‚Äì14 days.
   - Keep it small: Just one district or state.

2. **Farmer Advisory Mockup (UI)**
   - Simple **dashboard/web app** (Streamlit/Flask/React).
   - Input: crop + location.
   - Output:
     - Graph of **past vs predicted demand/price**.
     - Text: ‚ÄúBetter to sell in 5 days, expected price ‚ÇπX/kg in Bangalore market.‚Äù

3. **Actionable Recommendations (Rule-based layer)**
   - If forecasted demand ‚Üë ‚Üí recommend planting/selling.
   - If forecasted demand ‚Üì ‚Üí recommend diversification or delayed sale.
   - Very simple IF-ELSE logic, but judges will see **‚Äúfarmer-friendly guidance.‚Äù**

4. **Storytelling in PPT**
   - Problem ‚Üí Solution ‚Üí Demo ‚Üí Farmer Impact ‚Üí Future Enhancements.
   - Highlight **impact on smallholder farmers, reduced waste, stable income.**

## ‚ùå What You *Cannot* Implement in 24 Hours

These will kill your time ‚Äî avoid:

- **Nationwide crop coverage** (focus on 1‚Äì2 crops only).
- **Farmer mobile app with offline/local languages.**
- **Integration with government eNAM/APMC APIs in real-time.**
- **Logistics optimization (storage, transport, cold-chain).**
- **Large-scale ML pipelines with live data streaming.**

## üöÄ Future Enhancements (for PPT ‚Äì to impress judges)

This shows you thought beyond MVP:

1. **Multi-Crop Forecasting**
   - Extend beyond tomatoes/onions ‚Üí pulses, grains, fruits.

2. **Localized Farmer Advisory**
   - Mobile app/SMS/IVR in **regional languages**.
   - ‚ÄúFarmer-first design,‚Äù not just dashboard.

3. **Market Linkage & Logistics**
   - Connect farmers with wholesalers, retailers, FPOs.
   - Suggest alternative mandis when oversupply is predicted.

4. **Integration with Government Schemes**
   - Direct link to **eNAM, Agmarknet, FPO platforms**.
   - Help farmers avail MSP procurement when prices fall.

5. **Sustainability Angle**
   - Reduce food waste.
   - Promote crop diversification to prevent soil exhaustion.

6. **Scalability**
   - Offline-first architecture for low-connectivity areas.
   - ML models that run on edge devices (Raspberry Pi / mobile).
