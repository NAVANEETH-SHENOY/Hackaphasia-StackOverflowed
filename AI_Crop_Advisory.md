# AI-Driven Crop Advisory and Price Forecasting Platform

## Problem Statement
Farmers in India, especially in Karnataka, face recurring issues of **crop price crashes (gluts)** and **crop shortages** due to lack of accurate demand forecasting.  
Key issues include:
- Price volatility in essential crops (onion, tomato, potato, etc.).
- Lack of real-time guidance on whether to **sell, store, or shift crops**.
- Limited access to localized, credible, and data-driven recommendations.

## Proposed Solution
An **AI-powered advisory platform** that:
1. Predicts **crop prices** based on market trends, historical data, and seasonal demand.
2. Suggests whether a farmer should:
   - Sell immediately,
   - Store crops for better prices later,
   - Or switch to alternative crops.
3. Provides **crop planning guidance** to avoid overproduction.
4. Uses machine learning models to analyze:
   - Market arrivals & past price patterns,
   - Weather data,
   - Government MSP & procurement trends,
   - Consumer demand.
